# krun - run programs from your system in a microVM

`krun` allows you to run arbitrary programs from your system in a microVM. It's comprised of two small programs:

- `krun`: links against [libkrun](https://github.com/containers/libkrun) to create the microVM.

- `krun-guest`: acts as an entrypoint inside the microVM to set up the environment for running your program.

## Using

``` sh

Usage: krun [OPTIONS] COMMAND [COMMAND_ARGS...]
OPTIONS:
        -h    --help                Show help
              --net=NET_MODE        Set network mode
              --passt-socket=PATH   Instead of starting passt, connect to passt socket at PATHNET_MODE can be either TSI (default) or PASST

COMMAND:      the command you want to execute in the vm
COMMAND_ARGS: arguments of COMMAND

```

## Running graphical applications

If [sommelier](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/master/vm_tools/sommelier) is installed in your system, `krun` will use it to connect to the Wayland session on the hosts, allowing you to run graphical applications in the microVM.

GPU acceleration is also enabled on systems supporting [DRM native context](https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/2/contributions/53/attachments/76/121/XDC2022_%20virtgpu%20drm%20native%20context.pdf) (freedreno, amdgpu, asahi).

## Running x86/x86_64 on aarch64

If [FEX-Emu](https://fex-emu.com/) is installed in your system, `krun` will configure `binfmt_misc` inside the microVM so x86/x86_64 programs can be run transparently on it.

## Motivation

This tool is mainly intended to enable users to easily run programs designed for 4K-page systems on systems with a different page size, with [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org/) being the prime example of this use case.

Other potential use cases could be software isolation, accessing privileged kernel features (provided by the guest) or local testing.
